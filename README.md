Install celery:
```
pip3 install celery

```

Run redis (broker):

```
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis1 redis
```


Start some workers: 3 of them will process tasks sent to low-priority queue, and two will process tasks sent to celery queue

```
cd src
celery -A  tasks worker  -Q celery --loglevel=info
celery -A  tasks worker  -Q low-priority --loglevel=info
celery -A  tasks worker  -Q low-priority --loglevel=info
celery -A  tasks worker  -Q celery,low-priority --loglevel=info
```


Run clients:

```
cd src
python3 client1.py  // this client invoke task "add()" through the queue "low-priority"
python3 client2.py  // this client invoke task "sayhi()" through the queue "celery"
```

You can check the status of the tasks and nodes:

```
celery -A tasks status
```
